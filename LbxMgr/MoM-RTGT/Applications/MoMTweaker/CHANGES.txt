MoMTweaker
Author: Klaas van Aarsen


CHANGES IN 0.3.4 (2020-03-16)
-----------------------------
* Fixed cursor images from FONTS.LBX (column major).

* Fixed dependencies of Linux version (and upgraded it to Qt 5.14)



CHANGES IN 0.3.3 (2020-03-14)
-----------------------------
* Revised solution to find Steam version of MoM and CoM, so that it still
  works in e.g. Windows Vista.
  That is, the dependency to GetModuleFileNameA in psapi.dll that was
  introduced in 0.3.2 has been eliminated again.

* Show all fields such that they are consistent with Caster of Magic
  as per Seravy's comments.

* Visualize palettes and cursor images from FONTS.LBX in LBX editor
  based on information from Drake178.
  Replacing them does not work (yet).

* Released a Linux version as well.



CHANGES IN 0.3.2 (2020-03-12)
-----------------------------
* Fixed problem that Tweaker did not properly connect to the Steam version
  of MoM and CoM.

* New graphical view of the Building Tree, which is generated from the
  dependencies. It will also show unit requirements and prohibited races,
  but only if the corresponding information is available, e.g. when
  connected to the game.
  Available in the Tools window.

* Refer to actual names instead of old hard coded names in more places.
  So that if a spell has been renamed by a modder, that it actually shows up
  with the new name.
  Currently does not work yet if the spell name is a label in a sub tree view.
  So e.g. the Known Spells of a player are still shown with the wrong label
  in the main window.

* Cosmetic: eliminate the question marks in the caption bars.

* For the record, not all features of Tweaker will work correctly with
  Caster of Magic - yet. They may even crash. Work In Progress...



CHANGES IN 0.3.1 (2020-03-08)
-----------------------------
* Project requires at least C++11 to build.

* Recognize Seravy's v1.5+ and v5.0+ and show proper game data fields.

* Load and save Caster of Magic 6.0 save game files.
  The title bar will show "(MoM)" by default, "(CoM)" for Caster of Magic,
  "(CoM-)" if the file is smaller than expected, and "(CoM+)" if the
  file is larger than expected.
  Credit to Ariphaos for providing the CoM save game layout.

* Show actual spell names in the tree view instead of old hard coded names.

* Added more diplomacy information based on Seravy's comments (couple of years ago).



CHANGES IN 0.2.9 (2015-10-23)
-----------------------------
* Background images and icons are properly included again.

* Address Calculator allows you to change values now.
  Currently only 1 byte at a time, which happens when you press Enter.
  Be careful if you change the .EXE file!
  
* Renamed Building Queue dialog to Manage Cities and improved it.

* Level Bonus table can now also be edited if you load wizards.exe.

* All picture sequences can be replaced now, also the bigger ones.
  The palette may be a bit skewed though.
  Still need to figure out how to re-apply the correct palette.
  
* Added some diplomacy information based on Seravy's comments.
  
* Repop lairs will only repop if unoccupied (untested).

* The table of prefab artifacts now shows the header 'Artifact'
  instead of 'Special'.
  
* The caption includes the version of the Tweaker now.



CHANGES IN 0.2.8 (2013-12-30)
-----------------------------
* New Conjure Artifact Dialog (under Tools) that allows you to conjure
  any of the prefab items.

* Improved Building Queue Dialog and its optional automatic application.
  - No pop-up at next-turn is shown for a city that was managed.
  - The dialog shows more columns and information.
  - You can manage a city completely from the dialog (change farmers/
    workers, change production, buy production).
  - The (fixed) building queue has been improved.

* Added level bonus table with modified code in wizards.exe.
  - Allows to set the bonus for any level for any field.
  - Additionally allows a bonus for the number of shots.

* Export animations to animated .gif files in LBX editor.

* Display and export fonts in LBX editor.

* Improve detection of the actual location of the MoM directory.
  In particular if the mounted directory is not the MoM directory.

* Updated the prefav ItemData table with spell book requirement and 
  special status.



CHANGES IN 0.2.7 (2013-08-07)
-----------------------------

* Save/restore bookmark during battle (on battle map) [FrancoK].
  This works during the same battle. 
  To restore a battle bookmark after leaving the game, first restore 
  a save game from before the battle, enter battle again, and then 
  you can restore the bookmark. 
  Ticket: https://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/25/

* More tables (click Show tables):
  - Item powers from itempow.lbx (new).
  - Prefab item data from itemdata.lbx (new).
  - Many other tables whose data was already editable in the tree view.

* Lbx editor (click Tools, then click Lbx editor):
  - loads any lbx file and shows its contents
  - use the proper palette for all pictures
  - as yet it can only replace pictures and sequences of pictures.

* Drag & drop on the overland map and the battle map:
  - Either moves a stack of units.
  - Or simulates combat and shows the result in a message box.
    However, it's mostly raw melee now with static specials and enchantments.
    Shooting is not taken into account yet, nor all possible spells
    and special effects.
  
* Combat simulator added.

* Save and restore all dialog positions, sizes, check boxes, column widths, 
  directories, and combo boxes.
  
* Track created item location in the "MEM:Game Data" section.



CHANGES IN 0.2.6 (2012-09-08)
-----------------------------

* Fixed the failure to connect in Windows 7 that apparently 
  afflicted some people.
  All accessible memory is searched now (with a new algorithm).
  
* Added a battlefield map (click Map and select Battle).
  This completes the maps [Ayu].
  Ticket: http://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/12/
  Note that usually either the overland map or the battle map
  will be corrupted depending on whether battle is in progress or not.

* Added an experimental External AI dialog (click Tools, click External AI).
  You can set a hook in the code for use in battle.
  A hook will make the game stop each time an AI unit is on move.
  Then you can change its tactic manually and release the hook.
  
* Revised the address calculator to display more information.

* Added city name of fortress at the bottom of the wizard's data [FrancoK].
  Ticket: https://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/19/
 
* Combat round added [Asfex].
  Hero stats of all wizards added.
  Node attributes added to the tree model and also in the overland map.
  I do not know yet how it shows that it is warped though.
  Added check box "Use icons".
  Ticket: https://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/20/

* Fixed the 1.40m+ settings [FrancoK].
  There is one catch: if you load a save file, the tweaker does not know 
  the version of MoM, so it cannot show the 1.40m+ version of the fields.
  Ticket: https://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/18/

* Fixed LBX editor bugs [FrancoK].
  I've also added a "Save pics" button.
  Note that some LBX files contain both pictures and non-pictures.
  The non-pictures are shown as empty pictures now.
  Ticket: https://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/21/

* Removed close button from map dialog and closed ticket [FrancoK].
  Ticket: https://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/22/

  

CHANGES IN 0.2.5 (2012-08-22)
-----------------------------

* Added an LBX editor (click Tools / LBX editor) [Anthony,Aureustgo,FrancoK].
  When you load an LBX file with pictures, those will be shown in the 
  top view.
  The bottom view shows the bitmaps (png gif bmp jpg)
  that are in the directory of the tweaker, or one directory lower.
  I have included a couple of images that you can use.
  If you click "Replace" the LBX file is overwritten.
  To see the effect, MoM needs to be restarted (quit & continue).

* Completed the overland map view to show everything it should.
  Clicking on a tile will show what's there.
  It also allows you to change the fields of the tile's contents.

* Adjusted the Catnip mod to display what is changed, which is:
  1. All units get an extra half move.
  2. Heroes get dedicated slots (and a couple of changes).
  3. Magicians, priests, and shamen are renamed and get different abilities.
  TBH, this is not what Catwalk intended, but these are ideas I found
  fun to implement. ;)
  Btw, quitting MoM and continuing discards all changes.

* Added tax unrest table to Game data [Anthony].

  

CHANGES IN 0.2.4 (2012-08-02)
-----------------------------

* Added Anthony's spell-category information to the table of spells [Anthony].

* Made all fields in all tables editable (button "Show tables").
  Also added a context popup menu.
  The context menu contains at least "Ctrl+C" that allows you to copy
  and paste data to for instance Excel.
  Where applicable the selection(s) can be made from the popup menu
  (for instance the immunities of a unit).
  
* In particular the Unrest table is now editable. [letsdance]
  To make the changes permanent, load "TERRSTAT.LBX", make the changes,
  and save it.
  Ticket: https://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/17/
  
* Extended "Summon" dialog to display more fields under more circumstances.
  
* Fixed Customizer (Magic.exe) sections (which were damaged).
  
* Fixed <Unknown eMagic Powerful> (4) in Insecticide 1.40m+ [FrancoK]
  Ticket: https://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/18/

* Added max books/skills to EXE:Miscellaneous, so you can
  get more than 13 books and 6 skills [FrancoK].



CHANGES IN 0.2.3 (2012-06-21)
-----------------------------

* Attached help texts (from HELP.LBX) as tooltips to lots of items.

* Fixed and improved unit view (Summon dialog).
  In particular added: required buildings, type of ranged attack,
  help texts.

* Fixed "apply buildings" to build only allowed buildings and units
  (still need to fix that Sawmill and Miner's guild require forest resp.
  hills/mountains).
  
* Added nr of common spells you get for 2 books and up to MEM:Customizer 
  [letsdance].
  
* Added research bonuses to EXE:Miscellaneous [letsdance].
  Ticket: https://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/16/



CHANGES IN 0.2.2 (2012-04-04)
-----------------------------

* Speeded up the tree view by implementing lazy icons, meaning the tree view 
  only retrieves icons in a background process when there is spare time.
  
* Extended Overland map with terrain, bonus deposits, units, and a context 
  menu to pop up a unit view.

* Extended unit view (dialog Summon) with more extensive information.

* Added food bonuses in section EXE:Miscellaneous [Pax Empyrean].

* Updated address calculator to show addresses in DOS, the EXE files, the 
  SAVE files, and IDA.
  It triggers whenever you click a MoM field in the tree view.
  Ticket: https://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/5/

* Made fortress data editable. It's the last subtree in each Wizard in the 
  tree view [Question].
  Ticket: https://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/4/

* Fixed number of battle units to go up and/or down when for instance a demon 
  is summoned [Jtm].
  Ticket: https://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/3/
  
* Improved mechanism to find MoM in dosbox by a repeated search [Jtm].
  Ticket: https://sourceforge.net/p/momrtgt/tickets/2/



CHANGES IN 0.2.1 (2012-03-19)
-----------------------------

* Turned project into open source project on http://momrtgt.sourceforge.net/

* Added Summon unit dialog with a nice view of the unit to summon.
  In particular this handles all the details when summoning a hero.

* Moved all buttons that are not very interesting right now into a subdialog 
  named Tools.



CHANGES IN 0.1g (2010-12-19)
----------------------------

* Processed Kyrub's 1.40j present (all Spell Saves and City Wall modifiers 
  are editable now).

* Implemented a first version of the Select Initial Spells Dialog with 
  Catwalks proposal with guaranteed and starting spells.

* Added Hero-Initializers (Magic.exe) to the Customizer section.
  You can e.g. specify the random fighter/mage/any picks here.

* Added Building Data

* Added Events

* Added pictures loaded from UNITS1.LBX, UNITS2.LBX, MONSTER.LBX, 
  CITYSCAP.LBX (buildings), ITEMS.LBX

* You can load/save BUILDDAT.LBX, SPELLDAT.LBX, TERRSTAT.LBX (unrest) now.



CHANGES IN 0.1e (2010-12-04)
----------------------------

* You can Load/Edit/Save Wizards.exe and Magic.exe now.

  Note that changes in a connected game (button "Connect") are only partly 
  saved in the .exe files.
  That is, only sections marked MODIFIES Wizards.exe resp. MODIFIES Magic.exe 
  are saved.
  The other changes only have effect in memory.
  .Exe files loaded with the button "Load" are saved completely when 
  clicking "Save".
  
* The Customizer section has been extended with new fields.

* The "Show tables" button also shows the Unrest table now.
  
* The "Catnip (exp)" button has been extended to rewrite the code in 
  Wizards.exe so heroes can get other slot types.
  By default everything works as before, but the hero-type field in the 
  unit-type data can take on more values now.
  By default this is a number between 0 and 3 signifying Fighter, Bow, 
  Fighter/Wizard, or Wizard.
  Heroes of these types will get Sword-Shield-Ring, Bow-Shield-Ring, 
  Sword/Staff-Shield-Ring, resp. Staff-Ring-Ring.
  The new values are of the form: 6 + slot1 + 6 x (slot2 + 6 x slot3).
  Each slot has one of the values given by 0=Sword, 1=Bow, 2=Sword/Staff, 
  3=Staff, 4=Shield, 5=Ring.
  To give a hero e.g. Sword-Sword-Shield, his number must be: 
  6 + 0 + 6 x (0 + 6 x 5) = 186

* The "Catnip (exp)" button has been extended to incorporate the new 
  magician-types and cleric-types.
  The code in Wizards.exe is rewritten to store the new names.
  The magician-types and cleric-types have been adjusted with new abilities.
  Note that the magicians that have Caster 20 MP or 40 MP ability, have a 
  race of a color (e.g. Sorcery).
  This is necessary because otherwise they crash the game. 
  
* A couple of bugs have been eliminated.



CHANGES IN 0.1d (2010-11-28)
----------------------------

* Integrated the new Setup Customizer Tool.
  Now you can connect to MoM when you're doing the setup (Magic.exe).
  
* "Show Tables" now shows all available Unit Type data and available 
  Spell Data. 
  With Ctrl+C it they can be copied to Excel.

* Added various fields, among which the Random Generator in the Game Data.

* Redirected the standard outputs to cout_cerr.log in the Windows version 
  for diagnostic purposes.



CHANGES IN 0.1c (2010-11-23)
----------------------------

* Load and save of Wizards.exe simultaneous with Load/Save of SAVEn.GAM.
  Note that you can either connect to a game, or load/save SAVEn.GAM and 
  Wizards.exe.
  Effectively the Tweaker is now also a mod editor from which the changes 
  can be saved.
  
* More exposure of MoM data
   o Difficulty Table fully analyzed
   o Battle units further analyzed
   o New Battlefield
   o New Spells cast in Battle
   o Current unit view showing all current bonuses of a unit
   o Spell Saves (only when Wizards.exe is loaded)
   o Miscellaneous like Large Shield (only when Wizards.exe is loaded)
   o Note that a change in Spell Saves or Miscellaneous immediately affects
     a game being played with the same Wizards.exe.
     
* New "Show Tables" button that shows all Spell Data in a table view which
  can be copy-pasted in Excel. It is currently not editable.
  


CHANGES IN 0.1b (2010-11-09)
----------------------------
* Fixed a couple of bugs and updated the buttons to work consistently
* Extended the exposure of MoM data:
   o Difficulty Table (40 entries)
   o Races
   o Units: Unit Types, Hero Stats, Heroes Hired
   o Spells
   o Various names can now be changed as well
* New dialog for Apply Build Queues (proof-of-concept, although Apply works).



CHANGES IN 0.1a (2010-11-06)
----------------------------
First Linux version



CHANGES IN 0.1 (2010-11-05)
---------------------------
For those people who do not know about or believe in suppression yet.
In the Tweaker you can inspect all stats that are kept by MoM during a battle.
This includes the suppression stat!

As Kyrub explained, when you attack a unit, its suppression counter is 
incremented.
An increased suppression counter reduces the To Hit of the unit.
At the beginning of each battle round the suppression counters are reset.

Btw, the downloadable version has been renewed with more known fields in the 
Battle Units.

Furthermore this version has been used for its first field test: to create the
save games for tournament RB 1 (see tournament thread)!
The Tweaker is now, as far as I know, the only program (other than a hex 
editor) that gives you access to the home race of a wizard!

P.S.: Please note that the program is still in its proof-of-concept, 
sneak-preview phase, that is, not all buttons work quite as you would expect.



CHANGES IN 0.1 (2010-10-28)
---------------------------
To proof the concept of interactive modding, I've implemented Catnip's Basic 
Unit Changes. To activate them start MoM, start the Tweaker, click Connect, 
wait a couple of seconds (untill the Tree View is updated), and click 
"Catnip mod".
That's it, now you're MoM game is a Catnip mod.

Actually there are a few features of Catnip's Basic Unit Changes I did not 
implement yet:

   1. Large Shield still only gives +2 against ranged attack, because I do 
      not know yet where I should change this.
   2. The Clerics do not carry the name "Cleric" although they do function as 
      Clerics. Again because I don't know where to change this yet.
   3. E.g. Elven Lords are unchanged, since their name is not "Cavalry", but 
      e.g. Minotaurs are counted as foot units. But I leave this to you, 
	  because the Tweaker gives you the interface to change it!
   4. I was wondering if Catwalk meant Dwarven Swordsmen to be treated just 
      as any other Swordsmen, because now they are.



CHANGES (2010-08-01)
--------------------
First Windows GUI version name MoMInteractGameTweaker.

It features:
* Live connection to a MoM game in progress (DOSBox)
* Load / Save of SAVEn.GAM files
* Hero viewer with all related fields (Hired Hero, Items, Hero/Unit Config 
  Data, Hero Stats, Unit Status Data)
* Some nice graphics in tune with MoM
* Repop lairs
* Apply Build Queues

The Hero viewer is only a viewer because I wasn't yet able to make Qt let me 
edit the fields in the QTreeWidget. For some reason the fields are always 
read-only! (Does anyone know why this is?)

The Apply Build Queues I borrowed from the thread 'Mod Project Idea: 
Grand Vizier' from lemon and kyrub. There are some good ideas there:)!
Basically it's a proof-of-concept that you can manage your build queues from 
an external monitor program.
For now I've hardcoded the Build Queues.



CHANGES (2010-07-30)
--------------------
First Console version named IGTconsole.

IGTconsole is an Interactive Game Tweaker for Master of Magic 1.31.
When it is run it tries to connect to a MoM game in progress.
With the options you can specify to make changes in the MoM game.

Usage is:
  C> IGTconsole [ /option[=value] ... ]

NOTE: the options are case sensitive and spaces specified are mandatory.
The possible option combinations are:
/read=SAVEn.GAM [/write=SAVEm.GAM]
        Read from SAVEn.GAM instead of from memory
        Afterward write to SAVEm.GAM (optionally)
/repopLairs[=maxOut]
        Repopulate all lairs
         If 'maxOut' is specified, all lairs are
        cranked up.
/addHero=<heroNr> [/allPlayers]
        Adds the hero <heroNr> to your fortress.
        heroNr 0 is Brax, the Dwarf and 34 is Torin,
        the Chosen.
        If /allPlayers is specified, all players get
        the hero.
/validate
        Validates to see if the game is broken.
